# Yagna persistence db schema

This module is an implementation of Yagna Daemon persistance layer, required to record and maintain the aspects of Daemon funcitonality related to Market, Activity and Payment APIs.

It is based on SQLite3 and Diesel libraries.

## Prerequisites

Install Diesel CLI with SQLite:
```
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

Run the migration to apply SQL schema to working db file and generate `schema.rs`:
```
diesel migration run
```
It is also possible to re-generate:
```
diesel migration redo
```

For actual execution, the name of db file to be used is controlled via environment variable:
```
DATABASE_URL=yagna.sqlite3
```
