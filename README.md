## Golem

Official Rust implementation of Golem. Golem is a network of nodes that implement the Golem Network protocol. We provide the default implementation of such a node in the form of the Golem daemon, Yagna.

Golem Network has officially gone on Ethereum Mainnet with the [Beta I release](https://blog.golemproject.net/mainnet-release-beta-i/) in March 2021.

Golem democratizes societyâ€™s access to computing power by creating a decentralized platform where anyone can build a variety of applications, request computational resources and/or offer their idle systems in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens (GLM). The actors in this decentralized network can assume one of the three non-exclusive roles:

* **Requestor**
Has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by Golem's decentralized infrastructure.

* **Provider**
Has IT resources available that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

* **Developer**
Builds applications to run for requestors on the network. Golem's potential goes much beyond a singular application. See [Awesome Golem](https://github.com/golemfactory/awesome-golem/blob/main/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-apps) for just a taste of the various types of applications that can be built and run on Golem!

## Documentation
For a more in-depth look at how Golem works, head over to our [documentation.](https://handbook.golem.network/)

## Project Layout

* [agent/provider](agent/provider) - provider agent implementation based on core services.
* [core](core) - core services for the open computation marketplace.
* [exe-unit](exe-unit) -  ExeUnit Supervisor - a common part of all [runtimes](#runtimes) for yagna.
* [test-utils](test-utils) - some helpers for testing purposes
* [utils](utils) - trash bin for all other stuff ;)
* [docs](docs) - project documentation including analysis and specifications.

## Public API
The public API rust binding with data model is in the 
[ya-client](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-client) repo.

## High Level APIs
The public high-level API for Python is in 
[yapapi](https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi) repo and the JS/TS port is contained in the [yaJSapi](https://github.com/golemfactory/yajsapi) repo.

## Runtimes
We call our runtime **ExeUnit**. As for now we support
 * [Light VM](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-vm) - [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)\-based ExeUnit.
 * and WASM in two flavours:
   * [wasmtime](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-wasi) - [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)\-based ExeUnit.
   * [emscripten](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-emscripten) - [SpiderMonkey](https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs)\-based ExeUnit.

Other ExeUnit types are to come (see below).

## Golem Beta Release(s)
Important milestones for Golem development were [Beta I](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/tag/v0.6.1) and most recent [Beta II](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/tag/v0.7.0). With those releases we have delivered:
* MVP (minimum viable product), though not feature rich yet, it is usable for early adopters
* Clean and easy experience for new and existing users.
* Support for GLM payments (both L1 & L2 on Ethreum Mainnet)
* **Production-ready** and **easy to maintain** code base.
* **Modular architecture** with all the building blocks beeing replaceable.
* Small binaries (under 30Mb).
* [Documentation and SDK](https://handbook.golem.network/) for Golem app developers.
