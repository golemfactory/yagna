# Project YAGNA

![CI](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An open platform and marketplace for distributed computations.

## Project Layout

* [agent](agent) - applications based on core services. In MVP there are
* [core](core) - core services for open computation market.
basic wasm provider and simple wasm requestor.
* [exe-unit](exe-unit) -  ExeUnit Supervisor.
    * [wasm-mozjs](exe-unit/wasm-mozjs) - [SpiderMonkey](https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs) based ExeUnit.
    * [wasmtime](exe-unit/wasmtime) - [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) based ExeUnit.
* [service-bus](service-bus) - portable, rust-oriented service bus for IPC.
* [test-utils](test-utils) - some helpers for testing purposes
* [utils](utils) - trash bin for all other stuff ;)
* [docs](docs) - project documentation including analysis and specifications.

## Public API
Public API binding with data model is in 
[ya-client](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-client) repo.

## Requirements

* Clean and easy UX, especially during onboarding.
* Tokenocentric (GNT).
* Production-ready, modular and easy to maintain architecture and code base.  
_Modular_ means that all building blocks are to be easily replaceable.
* Documentation and SDK for developers.
* Binaries with small footprint.
