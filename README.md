# The Next Milestone (dubbed internally as YAGNA)

![CI](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An open platform and marketplace for distributed computations.

## Project Layout

* [agent](agent) - applications based on core services. 
* [core](core) - core services for the open computation marketplace.
basic wasm provider and simple wasm requestor.
* [exe-unit](exe-unit) -  ExeUnit Supervisor.
* [service-bus](service-bus) - portable, rust-oriented service bus for IPC.
* [test-utils](test-utils) - some helpers for testing purposes
* [utils](utils) - trash bin for all other stuff ;)
* [docs](docs) - project documentation including analysis and specifications.

## Public API
Public API binding with data model is in 
[ya-client](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-client) repo.

## Runtimes
We call our runtime **ExeUnit**. As for now we support WASM in two flavours:
   * [wasmtime](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-wasi) - [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)\-based ExeUnit.
   * [emscripten](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-emscripten) - [SpiderMonkey](https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs)\-based ExeUnit.

Other ExeUnit types are to come (see below).

## MVP Requirements

* Clean and easy UX, most specifically during onboarding.
* Token-centric (new GNT - ticker to be defined).
* Production-ready, modular and easy to maintain architecture and code base.  
_Modular_ means that all the building blocks can be easily replaceable.
* Documentation and SDK for developers.
* Small footprint binaries.
