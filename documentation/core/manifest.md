# Application Manifest Management (manifest)

The Application Manifest Management component in Yagna is responsible for processing and validating application manifests. These manifests define task requirements, capabilities, and permissions, ensuring that compute tasks are executed in accordance with specified parameters and security constraints.

## Key Features

1. **Manifest Parsing**: Parses manifest files in a standardized format (e.g., JSON, YAML).
2. **Validation**: Ensures that manifests adhere to the required structure and contain all necessary information.
3. **Capability Checking**: Verifies that requested capabilities are allowed and available.
4. **Permission Management**: Defines and enforces permissions for task execution.
5. **Version Control**: Supports multiple manifest versions for backward compatibility.

## Manifest Structure

A typical manifest includes the following sections:

1. **Version**: Specifies the manifest format version.
2. **Metadata**: Contains information about the application (name, description, author).
3. **Payload**: Defines the actual compute task and its requirements.
4. **Capabilities**: Lists the capabilities required by the task.
5. **Outbound Access**: Specifies allowed network access for the task.

## Manifest Processing Workflow

1. **Parsing**: The manifest file is read and parsed into a structured format.
2. **Version Check**: The manifest version is checked for compatibility.
3. **Validation**: The manifest structure and content are validated against a schema.
4. **Capability Verification**: Requested capabilities are checked against allowed capabilities.
5. **Permission Assignment**: Based on the manifest, permissions are assigned to the task.

## Integration with Other Components

The Manifest Management component interacts with several other Yagna components:

1. **Activity Management**: Provides task requirements and permissions for activity creation.
2. **ExeUnit**: Ensures that tasks are executed within the constraints defined in the manifest.
3. **Identity Management**: Verifies that the manifest signer has the necessary permissions.

## Code Example: Parsing and Validating a Manifest

Here's a simplified example of how a manifest might be parsed and validated:

\```rust
use ya_manifest::{ManifestParser, Manifest, ValidationResult};

fn parse_and_validate_manifest(manifest_str: &str) -> Result<Manifest, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let parser = ManifestParser::new();
    let manifest = parser.parse(manifest_str)?;

    match manifest.validate() {
        ValidationResult::Valid => Ok(manifest),
        ValidationResult::Invalid(errors) => {
            for error in errors {
                println!("Validation error: {}", error);
            }
            Err("Manifest validation failed".into())
        }
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let manifest_str = r#"
    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "metadata": {
            "name": "My Compute Task",
            "description": "A sample compute task"
        },
        "payload": {
            "runtime": "wasm",
            "code": "base64_encoded_wasm_code_here"
        },
        "capabilities": ["wasm", "outbound-network"],
        "outbound": {
            "urls": ["https://api.example.com"]
        }
    }
    "#;

    let manifest = parse_and_validate_manifest(manifest_str)?;
    println!("Manifest successfully parsed and validated: {:?}", manifest);

    Ok(())
}
\```

This example demonstrates:
1. Parsing a JSON manifest string into a structured `Manifest` object.
2. Validating the manifest to ensure it meets all requirements.
3. Handling validation errors and successful parsing.

The Application Manifest Management component plays a crucial role in ensuring that compute tasks are well-defined, secure, and executable within the Yagna ecosystem. It provides a standardized way to specify task requirements and permissions, facilitating seamless interaction between Requestors, Providers, and the Yagna platform.
