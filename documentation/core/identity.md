# Identity Management (identity)

The Identity Management component in Yagna is responsible for handling user identities, authentication, and authorization within the Yagna ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in ensuring secure access to Yagna services and resources.

## Key Features

1. **Identity Creation and Management**: Generates and manages unique identities for users and nodes in the Yagna network.
2. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users and nodes attempting to access Yagna services.
3. **AppKey Management**: Handles the creation, distribution, and validation of AppKeys for secure access to Yagna APIs.
4. **Integration with ACL**: Works closely with the Access Control Lists (ACL) component to enforce fine-grained permissions.

## Identity Types

Yagna supports multiple types of identities:

1. **Node Identity**: Represents a unique Yagna node in the network.
2. **User Identity**: Represents an individual user of the Yagna platform.
3. **Service Identity**: Represents a service or component within the Yagna ecosystem.

## AppKeys

AppKeys are a crucial part of the Identity Management system in Yagna:

1. **Purpose**: AppKeys provide a secure way for applications and services to authenticate and interact with Yagna APIs.
2. **Generation**: AppKeys are generated upon request and associated with specific identities and permissions.
3. **Validation**: The Identity Management component validates AppKeys for each API request to ensure proper authorization.

## Integration with Other Components

The Identity Management component interacts closely with several other Yagna components:

1. **ACL (Access Control Lists)**: Provides identity information for ACL to enforce access permissions.
2. **Network (net)**: Ensures secure communication by providing identity verification for network connections.
3. **Marketplace (market)**: Verifies identities of Requestors and Providers participating in the marketplace.
4. **Payment (payment)**: Ensures that payment transactions are associated with verified identities.

## Code Example: Creating an AppKey

Here's a simplified example of how an AppKey might be created using the Identity Management component:

\```rust
use ya_identity::IdentityManager;

async fn create_app_key(identity_manager: &IdentityManager, name: &str) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let app_key = identity_manager.create_app_key(name).await?;
    Ok(app_key)
}

async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let identity_manager = IdentityManager::new();
    let app_key = create_app_key(&identity_manager, "my-app").await?;
    println!("Created AppKey: {}", app_key);
    Ok(())
}
\```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using the `IdentityManager` to create a new AppKey.
2. Associating the AppKey with a specific name or purpose.
3. Retrieving the generated AppKey for use in API requests.

The Identity Management component ensures that AppKeys are securely generated, stored, and associated with the correct permissions, enabling secure and controlled access to Yagna services.
