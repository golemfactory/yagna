## Concepts

### Net API

An access point to the Golem Network. Abstracts away concepts like network addresses, transport and discovery. Nodes are reachable _only_ by their network identifier. The underlying implementation is primarily responsible for establishing communication channels between peers.

### Channel

A [PubSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern) pattern implemented as a network overlay. Channels will be executed as multiplexed logical channels within the Golem protocol. The protocol will enable multiple different callers per registered method.

**The multiple-caller aspect is out of scope of the PoC** and will only support a single caller.

Channels are mapped to service names and created via registering a service within the Golem Service Bus API module.

Each node is responsible for authorizing calls coming from the network. Typically, a requestor manages this kind of service authorization, i.e. by remotely populating whitelists on providers' Golem daemons.

### Service

Any entity that benefits from exposing its interface on the Golem Network. Usually an external processes or a (built-in) Golem daemon module.

Foreseen service types:

- an API implementation provider, e.g. a third-party Market API implementation external to the Golem daemon
- an ExeUnit instance, awaiting and responding to requestor's remote calls
- an application endpoint exposed on the Golem Network, providing functionality beyond the scope of daemon and SDK-provided capabilities; e.g. an FTP service

### Service address

A string that consists of node's id and the registered service name.

### Service registration

An API call to the GSB API module which binds a given service name string to the registered service process and route any incoming messages to that service. The latter is performed by calling an appropriate interface method, which is required to be implemented by the service.

Registration shares the lifetime of a "connection" between the GSB API module and the registered service.

### Service relaying

A state of exposing a Service interface directly on the Golem network. The interface may be called by any third party who poses the knowledge of that service's address.

The prerequisite for relaying is to register a service within the GSB API module. In consequence, messages addressed to that service will be routed to that service by the GSB API module. Responses are routed back to the caller either as a single reply or a stream.

### GSB API module

A module within the Golem daemon exposing the Golem Service Bus API.

## Authorization

**Service authorization in the Golem daemon is out of scope of the PoC version of lightweight Golem.**

Requires a service authorization API in the Golem daemon (not defined).

## Authentication and accounting

**Currently there are no plans to include service accounting and authentication in the PoC / MVP versions of lightweight Golem.**

Proposal: services can only be _authorized_ within the Golem daemon. Accounting will be handled internally by the Golem daemon.

## API definition

Due to the PubSub nature of the API, two different services need to be implemented by the GSB API provider and the registering service.

Note: authorization is not included in the scope of this proposal.

### Protocol Buffers

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package GSB_API;

/* Exposed by Golem Service Bus API implementation */
service Bus {
  /* Register a service within the bus */
  rpc Register (RegisterRequest) returns (RegisterReply);

  /* Call a local or remote service method */
  rpc ServiceCall (ServiceCallRequest) returns (CallReply);
}

/* Exposed by registering services */
service Service {
  rpc Call (CallRequest) returns (CallReply);
}

enum RegisterReplyCode {
  OK = 0;
  BAD_REQUEST = 400; // e.g. invalid name
  CONFLICT = 409;  // already registered
}

enum ServiceReplyCode {
  OK = 0;
  SERVICE_FAILURE = 500;  // e.g. service did not respond in time
}

enum ServiceReplyType {
  FULL = 0;  // a single response or end of stream
  PARTIAL = 1;  // i.e. a streaming response
}

message RegisterRequest {
  string service_id = 1;
}

message RegisterReply {
  RegisterReplyCode code = 1;
  string message = 2;  // in case of errors
}

message ServiceCallRequest {
  string address = 1;
  string request_id = 2;
  bytes data = 3;
}

message CallRequest {
  string request_id = 1;
  bytes data = 2;
}

message CallReply {
  string request_id = 1;
  ServiceReplyCode code = 2;
  ServiceReplyType type = 3;
  bytes data = 4;
}
```

## API implementation details

This section describes implementation hints and requirements for modules exposing the Golem Service Bus API.

### Message definition

According to the `protobuf` specification, as seen in the [example above](#protocol-buffers).

### (De)serialization

Provided by `protobuf` libraries.

The binary `data` field within the messages must be serialized with [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html).

### Transport

GSB API modules utilize a `nanomsg-next-gen` library with 2 transports enabled:

- IPC: unix sockets (Linux, macOS) and Named Pipes (Windows)
- TCP: all supported operating systems

Per language libraries:

- Rust: [runng](https://github.com/jeikabu/runng)
- C: [nanomsg-next-gen](https://github.com/nanomsg/nng)
- Python: [pynng](https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng)

### Encapsulated payload serialization

### Message routing

Provided by `nanomsg-next-gen` libraries.
