///   and choose the best from them.
/// - Extensibility: we expect, that developers will implement different market strategies.
///   In best case they should be able to do this without modifying `ya-provider` code.
///   This mean we should implement plugin-like system to communicate with external applications/code.
/// - Multiple negotiating plugins cooperating with each other. Note that introducing new features to
///   Agreement specification requires implementing separate negotiation logic. In this case we
///   can end up with explosion of combination to implement. What worse, we will force external
///   developers to adjust their logic to new Agreement features each time, when they appear.
///   To avoid this we should design internal interfaces, which will allow to combine multiple logics
///   as plugable components.
