## Set list of Ethereum nodes used by payment driver for specified networks.
## By default payment driver will query nodes addresses from DNS record `{network_name}.rpc-node.dev.golem.network`.
## Setting any of these variables will disable DNS lookup mechanism and use custom list of nodes instead for chosen network.
