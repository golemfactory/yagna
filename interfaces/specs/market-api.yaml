    ## Yagna Market

    The Yagna Market is a core component of the Yagna Network, which enables
    computational Offers and Demands circulation. The Market is open for all
    entities willing to buy computations (Demands) or monetize computational
    resources (Offers).

    ## Yagna Market API

    The Yagna Market API is the entry to the Yagna Market through which
    Requestors and Providers can publish their Demands and Offers
    respectively, find matching counterparty, conduct negotiations
    and make an agreement.


    This version of Market API conforms with capability level 1 of the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zny_vfgWV-hcsKS7P-Kdr3Fb0dwfl-6T_cYKVQ9mkNg">
    Market API specification</a>.


    Market API contains two roles: Requestors and Providers which are
    symmetrical most of the time (excluding agreement phase).

      description: >
        The Market Matching Mechanism, when resolving the match relation for the
        specific Demand-Offer pair, is to detect the “dynamic” properties required
        (via constraints) by the other side. At this point, it is able to query the
        issuing node for those properties and submit the other side’s requested
        properties as the context of the query.


        **Note**: The property query responses may be submitted in “chunks”, ie. the
        responder may choose to resolve ‘quick’/lightweight’ properties faster and
        provide response sooner, while still working on more time-consuming properties
        in the background. Therefore the response contains both the resolved properties,
        as well as list of properties which responder knows still require resolution.

        This is a blocking operation. The call may be aborted by Requestor caller

        It returns one of the following options:

        * `Ok` - Indicates that the Agreement has been approved by the Provider.
          - The Provider is now ready to accept a request to start an Activity
            as described in the negotiated agreement.
          - The Requestor’s corresponding `waitForApproval` call returns Ok after
            this on the Provider side.

        * `Rejected` - Indicates that the Provider has called `rejectAgreement`,
          which effectively stops the Agreement handshake. The Requestor may attempt
          to return to the Negotiation phase by sending a new Proposal.

        This is a blocking operation. The call may be aborted by Provider caller
        code. After the call is aborted or timed out, another `approveAgreement`
        call can be raised on the same `agreementId`.

        It returns one of the following options:

        * `Ok` - Indicates that the approved Agreement has been successfully
        delivered to the Requestor and acknowledged.
          - The Requestor side has been notified about the Provider’s commitment
            to the Agreement.
          - The Provider is now ready to accept a request to start an Activity
            as described in the negotiated agreement.
          - The Requestor’s corresponding ConfirmAgreement call returns Ok after
            the one on the Provider side.

        * `Cancelled` - Indicates that before delivering the approved Agreement,
        the Requestor has called `cancelAgreement`, thus invalidating the
        Agreement. The Provider may attempt to return to the Negotiation phase
        by sending a new Proposal.


        **Note**: It is expected from the Provider node implementation to “ring-fence”
        the resources required to fulfill the Agreement before the ApproveAgreement
        is sent. However, the resources should not be fully committed until `Ok`
        response is received from the `approveAgreement` call.
