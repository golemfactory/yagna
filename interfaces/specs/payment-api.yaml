  title: Yagna Payment API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: '
    Invoicing and Payments is a fundamental area of Yagna Ecosystem
    functionality. It includes aspects of communication between Requestor,
    Provider and a selected Payment Platform, which becomes crucial when
    Activities are executed in the context of negotiated Agreements. Yagna
    applications must be able to exercise various payment models, and the
    Invoicing/Payment-related communication is happening in parallel to
    Activity control communication. To define functional patterns of
    Requestor/Provider interaction in this area, Payment API is specified.


    An important principle of the Yagna Payment API is that the actual payment
    transactions are hidden behind the Invoice flow. In other words, a Yagna
    Application on Requestor side isn’t expected to trigger actual payment
    transactions. Instead it is expected to receive and accept Invoices raised
    by the Provider - based on Application’s Invoice Accept notifications, the
    Payment API implementation orchestrates the payment via a configured
    Payment platform.


    **NOTE: This specification is work-in-progress.**

        This is a blocking operation. It will not return until the Requestor
        has acknowledged rejecting the Invoice or timeout has passed.


        NOTE: A Rejected Invoice can be Accepted subsequently (e.g. as a result
        of some arbitrage).
